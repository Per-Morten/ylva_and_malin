Ylva and Malin is a side project created for me to toy with projects. It is a simple 2D RPG build with minimal library support, written in C.  
A development blog for the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Per-Morten/ylva_and_malin/wiki)

The motto of the project is:
Will this be good? Probably not.  
Will it be fast? Probably not.  
Will I learn a lot? Hell yeah.
