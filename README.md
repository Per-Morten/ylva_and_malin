Ylva and Malin is a small side project I am working on,
where I try to build a small 2D game with only a few helper libaries,
and whatever API's different OS' gives me.

Written in C-style C++, as MSVC does not support C11

Will this be good? Probably not.  
Will it be fast? Probably not.  
Will I learn a lot? Hell yeah.
